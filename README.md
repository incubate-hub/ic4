## Code Visualization Tool
This is a web application developed using Streamlit that helps developers identify potential anomalies in code by highlighting patterns of unusual occurrences. The application performs data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization on the Linux Kernel Git Revision History dataset to provide insights into the code.

## Requirements
The following libraries were used to develop this application:

Streamlit: A Python library used for building data-driven web applications that allows developers to create interactive and customizable web interfaces for machine learning models and data analysis.
Matplotlib: A Python library used for creating visualizations like line charts, scatterplots, and histograms, providing high-quality 2D and 3D plots for publication-ready figures.
Seaborn: A Python library based on matplotlib used for creating statistical graphics like heatmaps, violin plots, and box plots, that simplifies the creation of complex visualizations and enhances the overall aesthetics.
Pandas: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis, providing high-performance and easy-to-use data structures like DataFrame and Series for working with structured and labeled data.
NumPy: A Python library used for numerical computations and scientific computing, providing fast and efficient array operations for performing mathematical operations on large datasets.

## Usage
To use this application, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application using streamlit run app.py.
The application will open in your default browser, allowing you to interact with it.

## Dataset
The Linux Kernel Git Revision History dataset was used to develop this application. This dataset contains information about the Linux kernel development process, including the number of commits, the number of contributors, and the time between commits. The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/sash2394/linux-kernel-git-revision-history.
