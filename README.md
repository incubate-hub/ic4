# Code Visualization Tool
This is a web application developed using Streamlit that helps developers identify potential anomalies in code by highlighting patterns of unusual occurrences. The application performs data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization on the Linux Kernel Git Revision History dataset to provide insights into the code.

## Requirements
The following libraries were used to develop this application:

- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas
